CORRELATING BRAINS AND DNNS FOR IMAGES AND COLORS

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made great advances in the computer vision fields. In this analysis,
we study representation of colors in CNNs and in brains using the Python toolbox DNNBrain. We started with a
literature survey, studying papers on how colors are perceived by humans and macaque brains. Then we moved to the
DNNBrain toolbox, using its functionality to study how CNNs encode images as well as colors. We carry out a number
of experiments (provided by DNNBrain) to do this. Finally, we carry out a classification task on color classes. Here we
analyse two methods:
1. Transfer learning
2. Learning from scratch

Our hypothesis is that transfer learning will give better classification accuracy since features are extracted from CNNs
which already contain some information of the input picture, as seen from the experiments carried out.
